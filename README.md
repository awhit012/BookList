# Book List

*note: Part one is on the Master Branch. Check the branches for more where we add an external API and refactor into a component structure.*  

## Part 1:

Creating a full CRUD app for Books. Books can be created, read, updated, destroyed.

Books can be in on our "to read" list, in progress, or completed. 

In progress books track what page we are on. 

Books allow for us to rate them out of 5 stars, and make a comment.
